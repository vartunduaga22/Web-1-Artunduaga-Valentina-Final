# Web Starter Project
A foundational app for building with Express and Create React App.
Inspired by a desire to set my students up to win for my courses.

## What's inside?
* Node BE [Express](https://expressjs.com/) with sample GET and POST routes
* Node FE [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
* concurrently to run both simultaneously
* Local development CORS bypassing with `setupProxy.js`
* Wired up to deploy to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) should you choose to do so.
* `jsconfig.json` for app relative links

## How to use

```
yarn install && yarn dev
```
